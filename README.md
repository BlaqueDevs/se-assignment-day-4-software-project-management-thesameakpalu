Maintaining High Standards is important for   
 **user satisfaction, security, and long-term maintainability**

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

**ANSWER :**  
### **How Defining the Project Scope Contributes to Successful Project Planning**  
Defining the **project scope** is crucial because it sets **clear boundaries** for what the project will and will not include. A well-defined scope helps teams understand **deliverables, timelines, resources, and objectives**, reducing the risk of scope creep—where uncontrolled changes cause delays and budget overruns. It also improves communication among stakeholders by ensuring everyone agrees on expectations from the beginning. With a clear scope, project managers can effectively allocate resources, set realistic deadlines, and track progress, ensuring the project stays on course.  

### **What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Why is it Useful?**  
A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a **hierarchical breakdown** of the project's tasks, dividing them into smaller, manageable components. It :  
1. Improves Project Planning
2. Enhances Task Management 
3. Reduces Complexity 
4. Prevents Scope Creep  
5. Facilitates Progress Tracking 

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

**ANSWER :**  
  
A detailed project schedule ensures that a project stays on track, within budget, and meets deadlines. It provides a clear roadmap by outlining tasks, deadlines, dependencies, and resource allocations. It improves time management, Resource Optimization, Better Risk Management,and enhances team cordination.  
  

**How Gantt Charts Assist in Project Scheduling**  
1. Visualizing the Project Timeline
2. Tracking Task Dependencies  
3. Monitoring Progress
4. Resource Allocation
5. Identifying Critical Paths 

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

**ANSWER :**  
**A hypothetical problem to answer the question :**  
Many small businesses struggle with **inefficient inventory management**, leading to overstocking, stockouts, and lost sales.
